  abstract = {Identifying potentially vulnerable locations in a code base is critical as a pre-step for effective vulnerability assessment; i.e., it can greatly help security experts put their time and effort to where it is needed most. Metric-based and pattern-based methods have been presented for identifying vulnerable code. The former relies on machine learning and cannot work well due to the severe imbalance between non-vulnerable and vulnerable code or lack of features to characterize vulnerabilities. The latter needs the prior knowledge of known vulnerabilities and can only identify similar but not new types of vulnerabilities. In this paper, we propose and implement a generic, lightweight and extensible framework, LEOPARD, to identify potentially vulnerable functions through program metrics. LEOPARD requires no prior knowledge about known vulnerabilities. It has two steps by combining two sets of systematically derived metrics. First, it uses complexity metrics to group the functions in a target application into a set of bins. Then, it uses vulnerability metrics to rank the functions in each bin and identifies the top ones as potentially vulnerable. Our experimental results on 11 real-world projects have demonstrated that, LEOPARD can cover 74.0\% of vulnerable functions by identifying 20\% of functions as vulnerable and outperform machine learning-based and static analysis-based techniques. We further propose three applications of LEOPARD for manual code review and fuzzing, through which we discovered 22 new bugs in real applications like PHP, radare2 and FFmpeg, and eight of them are new vulnerabilities.},

A substantial difficulty with generating input files as test data is to recon the underlying structure and format of the files. In order to distinguish pure data stored in a file from the meta-data describing the file format, a deep learning method based on a neural language model is proposed in this article. The resultant learned model could be applied as a hybrid test data generator, to generate and fuzz both the textual and none-textual sections of the input file. Moreover, the model could be applied to generate test data to fuzz both the meta-data and the ordinary data stored in the file. Our experiments with two known fuzzing tools, AFL and Learn\$\textbackslash backslash\$\&Fuzz, demonstrate the relatively high code coverage of our proposed method.

However, such approaches have a drawback in that the outputs of the tests need to be manually checked for correctness, representing a significant burden for the software engineer. This paper presents a strategy to support the process of identifying which tests have passed or failed by combining clustering and semi-supervised learning. We have shown that by using machine learning it is possible to cluster test cases in such a way that those corresponding to failures concentrate into smaller clusters. Examining the test outcomes in clustersize order has the effect of prioritising the results: those that are checked early on have a much higher probability of being a failing test. As the software engineer examines the results (and confirms or refutes the initial classification), this information is employed to bootstrap a secondary learner to further improve the accuracy of the classification of the (as yet) unchecked tests. Results from experimenting with a range of systems demonstrate the substantial benefits that can be gained from this strategy, and how remarkably accurate test output classifications can be derived from examining a relatively small proportion of results.},

This requires inputs that trigger the malicious behavior to be applied during execution. All current methods, such as hard-coded tests, random fuzzing and concolic testing, can provide good coverage but are inefficient because they are unaware of the specific capabilities of the dynamic analysis tool. In this work, we introduce IntelliDroid, a generic Android input generator that can be configured to produce inputs specific to a dynamic analysis tool, for the analysis of any Android application. Furthermore, IntelliDroid is capable of determining the precise order that the inputs must be injected, and injects them at what we call the device-framework interface such that system fidelity is preserved. This enables it to be paired with full-system dynamic analysis tools such as TaintDroid. Our experiments demonstrate that IntelliDroid requires an average of 72 inputs and only needs to execute an average of 5\% of the application to detect malicious behavior. When evaluated on 75 instances of malicious behavior, IntelliDroid successfully identifies the behavior, extracts path constraints, and executes the malicious code in all but 5 cases. On average, IntelliDroid performs these tasks in 138.4 seconds per application.},

The fitness function measures how close an already discovered feasible path is to a particular test target (e.g., covering a not-yet-covered branch). Our new fitness-guided search strategy is integrated with other strategies that are effective for exploration problems where the fitness heuristic fails. We implemented the new approach in Pex, an automated structural testing tool developed at Microsoft Research. We evaluated our new approach by comparing it with existing search strategies. The empirical results show that our approach is effective since it consistently achieves high code coverage faster than existing search strategies.},

Many forensic analysis tools attempt to detect these hidden objects by scanning kernel memory with handmade signatures; however, such signatures are brittle and rely on non-essential features of these data structures, making them easy to evade. In this paper, we present an automated mechanism for generating signatures for kernel data structures and show that these signatures are robust: attempts to evade the signature by modifying the structure contents will cause the OS to consider the object invalid. Using dynamic analysis, we profile the target data structure to determine commonly used fields, and we then fuzz those fields to determine which are essential to the correct operation of the OS. These fields form the basis of a signature for the data structure. In our experiments, our new signature matched the accuracy of existing scanners for traditional malware and found processes hidden with our prototype rootkit that all current signatures missed. Our techniques significantly increase the difficulty of hiding objects from signature scanning.},

  abstract = {We present an automated evolutionary fuzzing technique to find bugs in JavaScript interpreters. Fuzzing is an automated black box testing technique used for finding security vulnerabilities in the software by providing random data as input. However, in the case of an interpreter, fuzzing is challenging because the inputs are piece of codes that should be syntactically/semantically valid to pass the interpreter's elementary checks. On the other hand, the fuzzed input should also be uncommon enough to trigger exceptional behavior in the interpreter, such as crashes, memory leaks and failing assertions. In our approach, we use evolutionary computing techniques, specifically genetic programming, to guide the fuzzer in generating uncommon input code fragments that may trigger exceptional behavior in the interpreter. We implement a prototype named IFuzzer to evaluate our technique on real-world examples. IFuzzer uses the language grammar to generate valid inputs. We applied IFuzzer first on an older version of the JavaScript interpreter of Mozilla (to allow for a fair comparison to existing work) and found 40 bugs, of which 12 were exploitable. On subsequently targeting the latest builds of the interpreter, IFuzzer found 17 bugs, of which four were security bugs.},

Traditionally, fuzz testing tools apply random mutations to well-formed inputs of a program and test the resulting values. We present an alternative whitebox fuzz testing approach inspired by recent advances in symbolic execution and dynamic test generation. Our approach records an actual run of the program under test on a well-formed input, symbolically evaluates the recorded trace, and gathers constraints on inputs capturing how the program uses these. The collected constraints are then negated one by one and solved with a constraint solver, producing new inputs that exercise different control paths in the program. This process is repeated with the help of a code-coverage maximizing heuristic designed to find defects as fast as possible. We have implemented this algorithm in SAGE (Scalable, Automated, Guided Execution), a new tool employing x86 instruction-level tracing and emulation for whitebox fuzzing of arbitrary file-reading Windows applications. We describe key optimizations needed to make dynamic test generation scale to large input files and long execution traces with hundreds of millions of instructions. We then present detailed experiments with several Windows applications. Notably, without any format-specific knowledge, SAGE detects the MS07-017 ANI vulnerability, which was missed by extensive blackbox fuzzing and static analysis tools. Furthermore, while still in an early stage of development, SAGE has already discovered 30+ new bugs in large shipped Windows applications including image processors, media players, and file decoders. Several of these bugs are potentially exploitable memory access violations.},

Unlike standard fuzzing techniques, which randomly change parts of the input file with little or no information about the underlying syntactic structure of the file, BuzzFuzz uses dynamic taint tracing to automatically locate regions of original seed input files that influence values used at key program attack points (points where the program may contain an error). BuzzFuzz then automatically generates new fuzzed test input files by fuzzing these identified regions of the original seed input files. Because these new test files typically preserve the underlying syntactic structure of the original seed input files, they make it past the initial input parsing components to exercise code deep within the semantic core of the computation.},

In the area of binary security, this is commonly done by using obfuscation methods to hinder reverse engineering and the search for software vulnerabilities. However, recent trends in automated bug finding changed the modus operandi. Nowadays it is very common for bugs to be found by various fuzzing tools. Due to ever-increasing amounts of automation and research on better fuzzing strategies, large-scale, dragnet-style fuzzing of many hundreds of targets becomes viable. As we show, current obfuscation techniques are aimed at increasing the cost of human understanding and do little to slow down fuzzing.},

  abstract = {Guided fuzzing has, in recent years, been able to uncover many new vulnerabilities in real-world software due to its fast input mutation strategies guided by path-coverage. However, most fuzzers are unable to achieve high coverage in deeper parts of programs. Moreover, fuzzers heavily rely on the diversity of the seed inputs, often manually provided, to be able to produce meaningful results. In this paper, we present Wildfire, a novel open-source compositional fuzzing framework. Wildfire finds vulnerabilities by fuzzing isolated functions in a Cprogram and, then, using targeted symbolic execution it determines the feasibility of exploitation for these vulnerabilities. Based on our evaluation of 23 open-source programs (nearly 1 million LOC), we show that Wildfire, as a result of the increased coverage, finds more true-positives than baseline symbolic execution and fuzzing tools, as well as state-of-the-art coverage-guided tools, in only 10\% of the analysis time taken by them. Additionally, Wildfire finds many other potential vulnerabilities whose feasibility can be determined compositionally to confirm if they are false-positives. Wildfire could also reproduce all of the known vulnerabilities and found several previously-unknown vulnerabilities in three open-source libraries.},

  abstract = {In recent years, coverage-based greybox fuzzing has proven itself to be one of the most effective techniques for finding security bugs in practice. Particularly, American Fuzzy Lop (AFL for short) is deemed to be a great success in fuzzing relatively simple test inputs. Unfortunately, when it meets structured test inputs such as XML and JavaScript, those grammar-blind trimming and mutation strategies in AFL hinder the effectiveness and efficiency. To this end, we propose a grammar-aware coverage-based greybox fuzzing approach to fuzz programs that process structured inputs. Given the grammar (which is often publicly available) of test inputs, we introduce a grammar-aware trimming strategy to trim test inputs at the tree level using the abstract syntax trees (ASTs) of parsed test inputs. Further, we introduce two grammar-aware mutation strategies (i.e., enhanced dictionary-based mutation and tree-based mutation). Specifically, tree-based mutation works via replacing subtrees using the ASTs of parsed test inputs. Equipped with grammar-awareness, our approach can carry the fuzzing exploration into width and depth. We implemented our approach as an extension to AFL, named Superion; and evaluated the effectiveness of Superion on real-life large-scale programs (a XML engine libplist and three JavaScript engines WebKit, Jerryscript and ChakraCore). Our results have demonstrated that Superion can improve the code coverage (i.e., 16.7\% and 8.8\% in line and function coverage) and bug-finding capability (i.e., 31 new bugs, among which we discovered 21 new vulnerabilities with 16 CVEs assigned and 3.2K USD bug bounty rewards received) over AFL and jsfunfuzz. We also demonstrated the effectiveness of our grammar-aware trimming and mutation.},

A substantial difficulty with generating input files as test data is to recon the underlying structure and format of the files. In order to distinguish pure data stored in a file from the meta-data describing the file format, a deep learning method based on a neural language model is proposed in this article. The resultant learned model could be applied as a hybrid test data generator, to generate and fuzz both the textual and none-textual sections of the input file. Moreover, the model could be applied to generate test data to fuzz both the meta-data and the ordinary data stored in the file. Our experiments with two known fuzzing tools, AFL and Learn\&Fuzz, demonstrate the relatively high code coverage of our proposed method. The experiments also indicate simple neural language models provide a more accurate learning model, than the complicated encoder-decoder models.},

We present a machine learning based framework to improve the quality of seed inputs for fuzzing programs that take PDF files as input. Given an initial set of seed PDF files, our framework utilizes a set of neural networks to 1) discover the correlation between these PDF files and the execution in the target program, and 2) leverage such correlation to generate new seed files that more likely explore new paths in the target program. Our experiments on a set of widely used PDF viewers demonstrate that the improved seed inputs produced by our framework could significantly increase the code coverage of the target program and the likelihood of detecting program crashes.},

At a high level, fuzzing refers to a process of repeatedly running a program with generated inputs that may be syntactically or semantically malformed. While researchers and practitioners alike have invested a large and diverse effort towards improving fuzzing in recent years, this surge of work has also made it difficult to gain a comprehensive and coherent view of fuzzing. To help preserve and bring coherence to the vast literature of fuzzing, this paper presents a unified, general-purpose model of fuzzing together with a taxonomy of the current fuzzing literature. We methodically explore the design decisions at every stage of our model fuzzer by surveying the related literature and innovations in the art, science, and engineering that make modern-day fuzzers effective.},

  abstract = {Fuzzing is a technique of finding bugs by executing a software recurrently with a large number of abnormal inputs. Most of the existing fuzzers consider all parts of a software equally, and pay too much attention on how to improve the code coverage. It is inefficient as the vulnerable code only takes a tiny fraction of the entire code. In this paper, we design and implement a vulnerability-oriented evolutionary fuzzing prototype named V-Fuzz, which aims to find bugs efficiently and quickly in a limited time. V-Fuzz consists of two main components: a neural network-based vulnerability prediction model and a vulnerability-oriented evolutionary fuzzer. Given a binary program to V-Fuzz, the vulnerability prediction model will give a prior estimation on which parts of the software are more likely to be vulnerable. Then, the fuzzer leverages an evolutionary algorithm to generate inputs which tend to arrive at the vulnerable locations, guided by the vulnerability prediction result. Experimental results demonstrate that V-Fuzz can find bugs more efficiently than state-of-the-art fuzzers. Moreover, V-Fuzz has discovered 10 CVEs, and 3 of them are newly discovered. We reported the new CVEs, and they have been confirmed and fixed.},
